# Legal Document Parser

## Overview
Legal Document Parser is an open-source project aimed at extracting and structuring information from legal documents. It first utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to make documents searchable, then applies structured parsing techniques to extract relevant data based on predefined formats.

## Features
- **OCR Processing**: Converts scanned legal documents into searchable text.
- **Structured Parsing**: Defines classes to parse documents based on their format.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable to support new legal document types.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Runs in a containerized environment for easy setup.
- **Open-Source**: Contributions are welcome to improve the parsing capabilities.
